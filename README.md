# FIRE-SPREAD-SIMULATION
A simulation of fire spread between trees will be conducted with the probability of a tree catching fire when a neighboring tree catches fire being 10%, 20%, 30%, ..., 90%. The simulation will start with 3 trees burning at certain positions. In this simulation, the flame spread method will be used.
